# Patterns & Lessons Learned

## Planning

- **Always write `docs/plans/*.md` and `docs/plans/*.json` as the very first action** before any code. Don't defer plan file creation to "implementation time" — CLAUDE.md requires them upfront.
- **Plans must NEVER include full code blocks.** Use code hints, descriptions, and references to existing patterns instead. The implementer writes the code, the plan guides them.
- **One markdown file per phase.** Do NOT create separate design and implementation plan files. Merge the design into the top of the implementation plan.

## Project Structure

- **All Go transpiler code lives in `sloplang/` subfolder**, not the project root. The project root has `docs/`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc. The `sloplang/` subfolder has `go.mod`, `cmd/`, `pkg/`, `examples/`.
